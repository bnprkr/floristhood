## Technologies

This project used React and Redux on the frontend and Node.js, Express.js and PostgreSQL on the backend. Redux was used to manage frontend state associated with user authentication and authorisation. Express.js was used to serve the React build files and to manage authentication and authorisation routes, with PostgreSQL (via Sequelize ORM) to store and query user account data. CSS modules were used to isolate CSS to individual React components.

## Motivation

This project was primarily a learning activity, to gain experience of implementing a frontend using the React framework. This gave me experience of using React to setup components and manage state, user interaction and API calls. It was also an opportunity to use Redux to manage state associated with user authentication and authorisation as well as to implement more design elements with CSS.
